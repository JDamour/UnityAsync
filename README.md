> Async task utility package for Unity
> Helper methods for starting tasks on the Unity thread.
> Start and await coroutines from any thread.

## Quick Start

### Start and Await a coroutine from anywhere
```c#
//Start a coroutine from anywhere without a monobehaviour
//Your coroutine will run on the main thread
var task = CoroutineRunner.RunAsync(MyCoroutine());
//You can await the returned task which will complete when the coroutine is done
await task;
```

### Start a Task on the main unity thread from anywhere
```c#
//This will execute MyMethod on the main Unity thread
var task = UnityTaskUtil.RunOnUnityThreadAsync(MyMethod);
//A task is returned that you can await
await task;
```

### Switch between Main thread and Background thread in any task
```c#

// Currently on main thread
await Awaiters.BackgroundThread;
//You should now be on a background thread

//Await one frame
await Awaiters.NextFrame;

//Currently on a background thread
await Awaiters.MainUnityThread;
//Task is now running on the Unity main thread

```
